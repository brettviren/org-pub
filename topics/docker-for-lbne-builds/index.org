* Docker

[https://www.docker.com/ Docker] provides a way to create Linux "containers" which are like  VM images but are more like =chroot= jails.  As such they run closer to the bare host and are less process intensive and quick to provision, start up and bring down.  Docker manages its images in a space-efficient manner and provides for versioning somewhat like one has with a git repository.

The main benefit I see in using Docker is that I can precisely define the base Linux distribution hosting the build as well as exactly what additional OS-level modifications needed.  And I can do this on many different distributions without the overhead of buying dedicated hardware .
