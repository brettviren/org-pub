#+DESCRIPTION: A description of how I read mail.
#+SETUPFILE: ~/org-pub/topics/setup.org

* Overview

My email landscape is as shown in the figure below.  The "workstation" is on the internal wired network at work and the "laptop" represents either a machine on the wireless network or on a external network.  The "infrastructure" represents the facilities on the internal network.  Left implicit there is the SSH gateway through which the port forwarding shown as dashed lines happen.  Details on these parts are in the sections below.

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :cmd dot :cmdline -Tpng  :file email.png :exports results

	graph [clusterrank=local];

        me [label="me", shape="house"];

	}

	subgraph cluster_workstation {

* SSH Tunnels

Outside of the internal work network I use SSH tunnels to forward local ports to the IMAP and SMTP servers running on the workstation.  This is represented by the dashed lines in the figure.  I initiate this forwarding on an ad-hoc basis with the command:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ssh -L 1143:localhost:143 -L 2525:localhost:25 lycastus
#+END_EXAMPLE

The =lycastus= host is my workstation on the internal network and is not actually directly accessible from external networks.  This apparently direct connection succeeds due to an entry in =~/.ssh/config= which implicitly directs through the department SSH gateway:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Host lycastus
  User bviren
  Hostname lycastus.phy.bnl.gov
  HostKeyAlias lycastus.phy.bnl.gov
  ProxyCommand ssh -A bviren@gateway.phy.bnl.gov /bin/nc lycastus.phy.bnl.gov 22
  ...
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Email Client - GNUS

I use [[http://www.gnus.org/][GNUS]] as my email client.  It is configured to read email via IMAP so any client that can speak that protocol could replace GNUS in this setup.  In fact, I've played with Thunderbird in this context.  Besides being slow and not intuitive compared to GNUS, it works (but see [[Problems with GNUS]].  Technically, GNUS doesn't send mail but I'm pretending that it does to keep appearances simple.  The network asymmetry between inside and outside the internal network leads to a dichotomy in the Emacs configuration for GNUS.  Since I use the same [[https://github.com/brettviren/dot-emacs][Emacs configuration]] on all accounts I handle this by switching on the host name:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(cond
 ((string= system-name "lycastus.phy.bnl.gov")
  (message "Using BNL")
  (setq gnus-init-file "~/git/dot-emacs/dot-gnus-lycastus.el"
	user-mail-address "bv@bnl.gov"))
 (t (message "Using not-BNL")
    (setq gnus-init-file "~/git/dot-emacs/dot-gnus-hal.el"
	  user-mail-address "bv@bnl.gov"))
)
#+END_SRC

The "laptop" host (nominally named =hal=) is configured to talk through these forwarded ports with:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (setq gnus-secondary-select-methods
        '((nnimap "bnl"
                  (nnimap-address "localhost")
                  (nnimap-server-port 1143)
                  (nnimap-stream network)
                  (nnimap-authenticator login))
          ))
  
  (setq message-send-mail-function 'smtpmail-send-it
        smtpmail-smtp-server "localhost"
        smtpmail-smtp-service "2525")
#+END_SRC

The "workstation" host's GNUS setup is similar but uses the standard ports and thus does not require that second stanza.

** TODO Problems with GNUS

Despite being my email client of choice for about a decade, GNUS is not perfect.  In the context of this setup some of the problems that still exist:

 - group ordering is kept in files that I do not yet sync between systems.  
 - outgoing archives are kept local so get scattered, although replies made from inside a group should be sent to IMAP
 - sharing BBDB

* Incoming

Email sent to =bv@bnl.gov= winds through the infrastructure SMTP gateway and if it is not obvious SPAM it gets delivered to the workstation SMTP server.  That server (exim4) is configured to key off the existence of a =~/.procmailrc= file to know that instead of normal delivery it should pipe it through the [[http://www.procmail.org/][procmail]] program run as my user.  The configuration of =procmail= is best left for another topic but it results in a [[http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html][Maildir]] directory hierarchy with many folders.  Typically each mailing list to which I belong is mapped to a subdirectory under =~/Maildir/=.  In general, mail is sorted based on its headers either explicitly or through matching (which requires me to periodically check for new folders as I get subbed to new lists).  All mail that is not matched by procmail falls into a =default= folder which is effectively my INBOX.

* Retrieving

The workstation runs the [[http://www.dovecot.org/][Dovecot IMAP daemon]] which is configured to look at my =~/Maildir/= directory.  I used to run Dovecot's =imapd= as a subprocess under GNUS in order to avoid supplying my password.  This works since GNUS and Dovecot runs on the same system that supplies =~/Maildir/=.  However, it would make it challenging (and slow) to do this over SSH.  So to keep as much symmetry between "laptop" and "workstation" I moved to running it as a daemon (which is the default for the Debian/Ubuntu installation anyways).  This had the nice side effect to slightly increase speed (a real speed boost came from moving =~/Maildir/= to a SSD). 

* Sending

In all cases, mail is sent through the workstation SMTP server (exim4).  In the case of originating on the laptop this server is accessed via the SSH tunnels and because of the non-standard port number used in this forwarding Emacs's =smtpmail= needs special configuration as shown above.  This SMTP server is configured (as all on the internal network are) to forward email to the site's SMTP "smarthost" (named just =bnl.gov=) for delivery to wherever it is destined.

* Searching

** Maildir

I used to use [[http://notmuchmail.org/][notmuch]] to index my mail in =~/Maildir=.  It has nice search capabilities including a nice Emacs UI, however it was rather slow to index.  I now use [[http://www.rpcurnow.force9.co.uk/mairix/][mairix]] which is blisteringly fast to index - so much so I often wonder if it's doing *anything* (it is).  

** IMAP

Gnus has built-in support for using IMAP's search facilities.  Just hit =G G= in the Group buffer.  The benefit is that it works the same on both laptop and workstation but it's quite a bit slower than =mairix=.


* Gmail

Gnus can be made to read from Gmail however I've not been able to do so in a way that replicates the features of Gmail's web interface.  In particular, I get all the spam, "helpful" commercial email all mixed in to the INBOX.  I happen to keep the use of my Gmail and BNL addresses for separate purposes and keeping how I access the two distinct is acceptable and preferable as it helps to emphasize this separation.
